Takeaways:

factoring_code.c (Runtime error)
-----------------
1. Segfaults signal the occurrence of undefined behavior. OS responds by killing the program.
2. Error's may occur in code well before Segfault occurs.
3. Single-stepping through a program using a debugger and breakpoints increase
   the understanding of program flow, and can help identify errors.

pi.c (Hidden error)
----
1. Sometimes errors in code do not raise a compiler error, OR a runtimer error (Segfault)
2. Often many iterations must occur before an error that actually prevents further
   execution to occur. These errors can be very tedious to identify with print statements
   because the program flow might actually change with the addition of a simple print statement!"
3. Conditional break points (and often together with print statements) can speed up diagnosis of 
   the problem.
